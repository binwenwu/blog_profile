# <Hello>你好👋, &nbsp;I'm Binwen Wu</Hello>

I'm a developer from Wuhan, with a love for writing `code`. I post blogs on [tankenqi.cn](https://www.tankenqi.cn/).

In my spare time, I study "Golang". I am trying to write some English posts to improve my English proficiency, with the aim of working remotely in the future.

I also like badminton🏸 and tennis🎾, but I don't do risky tricks.
